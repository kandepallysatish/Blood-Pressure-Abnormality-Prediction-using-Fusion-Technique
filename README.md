Unawareness of a disease can be very dangerous and when it comes to an abnormality in blood pressure, it can be life-threatening. Hypertension or blood pressure higher than normal that is 140 /90 can give birth to diseases like cardiac arrest, dementia, or even deaths. Although, the good news is that abnormal blood pressure can be treated if predicted before it's too late. Managing hypertension is easier with medications and treatment if detected timely. This paper focuses on the prediction of the likeliness of abnormality in blood pressure in people in the future. In simpler terms, it predicts the chances of people prone to develop hypertension or hypotension. The prediction would be based on 13 different attributes like Level of Hemoglobin, Genetic Pedigree Coefficient, Age, BMI, Sex, Pregnancy, Smoking, Physical activity, salt content in the diet, alcohol consumption per day,	Level of Stress, Chronic kidney disease, Adrenal and thyroid disorders and so on. This paper can provide medical foresight using classification algorithms that can help people to understand the factors that increase blood pressure. Therefore, by making certain possible amendments in their lifestyle like salt content in food, alcohol consumption, etc. people can keep their blood pressure in range. The paper provides insight and comparison of several supervised learning algorithms and gives an overall summary of the existing work.


we achieved near to 99.07% Accuracy on Fusion Model (AdaBoosted Random Forest Classifier)
